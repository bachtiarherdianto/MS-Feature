This repository contains the **data analysis associated with the study on learning from past solutions**, presented in our preprint manuscript _Feature-Guided Metaheuristic with Diversity Management for Solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem._, which has now been accepted for publication in the **European Journal of Operational Research (EJOR)**.

The analysis code, datasets, and related resources  will be released in a future update. Additional time is currently needed to further prepare, clean, and organize the files so that it is well documented.

If you have any questions or would like to receive updates regarding the files, please feel free to contact me at bachtiarherdianto@gmail.com

Thank you for your interest and understanding.
